## Summary

Repo for the 'Learn the HTTP Protocal' on Boot.dev

## Learning Goals

- Understand the big ideas of HTTP, and implement the HTTP/1.1 protocol. (Look, the RFC is long, but the main points are fairly straightforward). You'll understand from a high level what happens when you fetch("google.com").
- To feel like a wizard, building the protocol of the internet from scratch.
- To gain more challenging programming practice, and a deeper understanding how web applications work.
- To have a good time.
